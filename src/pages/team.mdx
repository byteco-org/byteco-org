Byteco is a disruptive innovation for a new generation of blockchain technology. All kinds of professionals are needed to join in and jointly promote the implementation and application of blockchain and artificial intelligence technology


# Curent Team

# **Founder**

- James Muskin
Graduated from Stanford, master of financial engineering and master of physics.  In 2017, he founded a low altitude aircraft venture company. This is a science fiction project. The low altitude aircraft has no traditional propeller and can take off and land at any place. The existing fixed wing propeller aircraft can not take off and land on the road, because it will lead to traffic accidents.
