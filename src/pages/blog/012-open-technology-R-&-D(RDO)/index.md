## R&D

The essence of the science and technology R&D industry is to mobilize social resources, including market and non-market factors such as technology, manpower, capital, materials, manufacturing, etc., with high costs and large uncertainties in returns. Byteco is close to free coordinated design, revocable contracts and privacy applications can greatly reduce R&D costs, especially long-tail R&D projects that do not match market capacity and R&D investment, and are more friendly to human society.
