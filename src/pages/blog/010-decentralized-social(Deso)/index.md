## Decentralized Social


## Current Approaches

Artificial intelligence is widely used in social applications, relational models, intelligent search, etc. will increase the potential of decentralized social applications, and privacy applications will better eliminate people's concerns about decentralized social interaction. Social networking consists of weak relationships most of the time, and the willingness to pay is low. If the cost on the chain is too high, it will be disastrous for the development of relationships. At the same time, revocable contracts are widely used in social relationships, and strict contracts are too rigid and not suitable for social relationships. Fair and free social relations are also extremely lacking in the existing social system. The use of artificial intelligence, revocable contracts and free interaction fees can maximize the realization of social relationships in an equal, free, open, and efficient next-generation intercommunication network, and further improve social productivity and information transmission capabilities.
