From the sociological point of view, all kinds of social relations in human life are contracts (also called agreement), and conventions commonly known as ethics and laws are used to restrain people from complying with contracts to ensure the benign operation of social order. Due to time differences, regional differences, differences in human living habits, language barriers, communication effectiveness, cross-organizational coordination barriers, the degree of game between the two parties, earthquakes, fires, floods and other force majeure and other complex social relations constraints. The scope of use of contracts is less than 1% of social scenarios, while revocable contracts are applicable to about 80% of social scenarios due to their flexibility, while the remaining 19% of social scenarios are non-contractual relationships.


Since the birth of Bitcoin as the pioneering technology of blockchain technology, the second generation of blockchain represented by Ethereum has realized the integration of contract technology. This chain is dedicated to the implementation and integration of revocable contract technology. As the name implies, a revocable contract is a contract that can be changed, renewed, and destroyed. If you cannot understand the concept of revocable contracts, then the existing blockchain crowdfunding and flash loans are the primary manifestations of revocable contracts.


Specifically in the field of decentralized finance, most hacker attacks at this stage can be avoided, and at the same time, it does not rely on the behavior of centralized administrators. Revocable contracts used in upgradeable contracts will become very friendly for developers.
