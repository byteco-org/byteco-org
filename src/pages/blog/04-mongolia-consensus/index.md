The current blockchains on the market all adopt Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus or a consensus method that is slightly improved on the basis of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus. They all have a common feature, safety, high fault tolerance, but low efficiency.

The most powerful army in the Cold Weapon times is undoubtedly the Mongolian army, with power almost all over the Eurasian continent. Relying on three secret weapons, they swept across Asia and Europe in just a few decades, and they were invincible. These three secret weapons are tightly organized, advanced bows and arrows, and Asian horses with excellent endurance. The first of the rigorous offensive organizations is the pre-war consensus meeting model developed by Genges Khan and his counselors, which we call the Mongolian consensus. Advanced Mongolian bows and arrows can easily penetrate shields, and Asian horses with excellent endurance can provide good conditions for creativity in long-distance attacks. Among them, the Mongolian Consensus has played a decisive role. It is a model of rapid human cooperation.

The Mongolian Consensus is an efficient and secure consensus agreement. The security, speed, and scalability mentioned in the blockchain ceiling theory cannot be complete. The Mongolian Consensus achieves model optimization in these three aspects to promote the application of industrial blockchain technology.
